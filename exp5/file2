Until the 1960s, India failed to spend a lot on defense and we paid the price in costly wars with neighbors who took us for a pushover. In the global field, if you fail to have a strong deterrent, you will become a football played by other powers. To build a strong economy & eliminate poverty, we need to be sure that our borders are sound. A weak nation cannot grow a strong economy. Since the 1970s, we have been able to avoid direct wars (touchwood) and part of it is owed to our stable position
