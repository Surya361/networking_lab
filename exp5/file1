India spends 2.2% of its annual income (GDP) on defense and that is exactly the world average. Given that we have two nuclear armed neighbors, a troubled neighborhood that hosts the Talibans, sea pirates, despots and a growing internal menace of communist extremists this is not unjustifie 4000 years ago, in the banks of Indus, we had a really advanced civilization. Those people built fantastic cities, highly planned road system and completely peaceful. They knew no war, no weapons. As a result, they were not well prepared to face the natural disaster (or a human disaster) that would come to wipe them.
